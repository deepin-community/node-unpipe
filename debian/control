Description: Unpipe a stream from all destinations
 Unpipes all destinations from a given stream. With stream 2+, this is
 equivalent to stream.unpipe(). When used with streams 1 style streams
 (typically Node.js 0.8 and below), this module attempts to undo the
 actions done in stream.pipe(dest).
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
